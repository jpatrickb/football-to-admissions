title: Football Performance and Admissions
---

Welcome. This site presents the statistical analysis and presentation of results we prepared for the 2025 BYU Statistics Case Competition. It is a findings-first summary of how NCAA football performance relates to university admissions outcomes.

TL;DR
- Higher win rates are associated with increases in enrollment over time at many schools, but we lack sufficient applicant-count data to quantify attraction effects directly.
- Diversity: higher win rates tend to correlate with a higher proportion of white students, lower proportions of Hispanic and Asian students, and generally little effect on the proportion of Black students—aside from a small subset where the Black proportion increases with performance.
- Cost clusters: in high-cost institutions, win-rate effects on demographics are minimal to negligible; effects are more pronounced in lower- and mid-cost clusters.
- “Caliber” proxies (ACT/SAT, retention, completion) were inconclusive overall and varied by cost cluster.
- Causality caution: reverse causality is plausible (admissions ↔ team performance), so results should be interpreted as associations rather than causal effects.
