title: Limitations and Suggestions
---

Limitations
- Applicant counts were insufficient to model attraction effects directly.
- Reverse causality is plausible: football performance can influence admissions decisions and resources, which can feed back into performance.
- Defining “high caliber” is nontrivial: high test scores may proxy for access to resources; some definitions should include diversity.
- Enrollment is not a perfect outcome because many universities operate with capacity caps and policy limits.

Suggestions
- We do not find sufficient evidence to recommend broad investments in football solely to improve admissions metrics.
- Anecdotally, some universities that expanded athletics broadly (dozens of new programs) reported increases in applicants and enrollment, but heterogeneity by race and gender is unknown.
