title: Findings â€” Cost Clusters
---

Clustering approach
- We clustered schools by overall cost (in- and out-of-state tuition plus average living expenses).
- School-type clustering did not materially change results; we therefore emphasize cost-based clusters.

Key observations
- In high-cost institutions, win-rate effects on demographics are minimal to negligible.
- Effects are more pronounced in low- and mid-cost clusters.

Example schools by cost tier
- Low: Akron, BYU, Air Force (small state schools and military academies)
- Mid: Alabama, Arizona State, Boise State, Central Florida, Ohio State (most state schools)
- High: Harvard, Yale, Vanderbilt, Notre Dame, Princeton (Ivy-League, expensive private schools)

Notes
- Cluster-specific SHAP summaries provide the most reliable view of heterogeneity; interpret as associations.
