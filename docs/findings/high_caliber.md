title: Findings — Higher-Caliber Proxies
---

Targets and approach
- Proxies: ACT and SAT scores, retention, and completion rates.
- Models: XGBoost Regressors with SHAP to examine the marginal effect of win–loss ratio.

Summary of results
- Initial results were inconclusive overall.
- Effects varied by cost clusters: relationships differed across low-, mid-, and high-cost institutions.
- In the high-cost cluster, we found little to no effect of win rate on these proxies.

Interpretation notes
- Definitions of “high caliber” are fraught: higher test scores may reflect access to resources rather than innate ability, and diversity goals may point to a broader notion of caliber.
- Given heterogeneity and potential confounding, we do not draw strong conclusions from these proxies.
