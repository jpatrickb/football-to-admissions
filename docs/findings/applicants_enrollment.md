title: Findings â€” Applicants and Enrollment
---

Key points
- Our interest was in how performance affects student interest. Applicant counts are the cleanest measure, but our applicant data were insufficient for robust modeling.
- We therefore examined enrollment trends as a proxy, with the caveat that many universities face capacity and policy limits.
- We observe that schools with consistently improving win rates tend to have increasing enrollment over time.

Interpretation caveats
- Capacity limits and admission rate policies confound the enrollment signal.
- Reverse causality likely: admissions resources and outcomes can recycle into program quality and performance.
