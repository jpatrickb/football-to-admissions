# Methodology

## Overview

- Outcome focus: admissions-related outcomes (enrollment, applicants when available) and composition (race and gender proportions), plus higher-caliber proxies (ACT/SAT, retention, completion).
- Primary exposure: football team performance measured as seasonal win–loss ratio (normalizes across teams with different numbers of games).
- Covariates: expenses, tuition (in/out of state where available), and region.
- Models: XGBoost regressors fit separately for each target.

## Why gradient boosting and SHAP

- Pair plots did not reveal strong linear or polynomial relationships, reducing the appeal of OLS for inference.
- XGBoost flexibly learns nonlinearities and interactions.
- SHAP values allow us to quantify the marginal contribution of win–loss ratio (and other features) to each prediction and summarize distributions of effects across schools and years.

## Clustering strategy

- We explored clustering by school type and by cost (tuition + living expenses).
- Cost-based clusters were more informative: in high-cost institutions, the effect of win rate on demographics is much smaller; we report results by cost tiers where relevant.

## Notes

- SHAP interpretations reflect association, not causation (reverse causality likely exists).
- Enrollment can be capacity-constrained; applicant counts would more directly capture attraction effects, but these data were insufficient.
