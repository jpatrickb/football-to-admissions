# Findings

## Applicants & Enrollment

- Our interest was in how performance affects student interest. Applicant counts are the cleanest measure, but our applicant data were insufficient for robust modeling.
- We therefore examined enrollment trends as a proxy, with the caveat that many universities face capacity and policy limits.
- We observe that schools with consistently improving win rates tend to have increasing enrollment over time.

> Caveats: Capacity limits and admission rate policies confound the enrollment signal. Reverse causality likely: admissions resources and outcomes can recycle into program quality and performance.

## Diversity by Race

- Higher-performing football teams tend to have higher proportions of white students.
- Higher win rates are associated with lower proportions of Hispanic and Asian students.
- Effects on the Black student proportion are generally small, with a minority of schools showing a positive association with performance.

Selected figures

- White proportion vs win rate (SHAP):

- Hispanic proportion vs win rate (SHAP):

- Asian proportion vs win rate (SHAP):

> Notes: Figures summarize SHAP interactions/attributions for the win–loss ratio feature while controlling for expenses, tuition, and region. Associations, not causal effects.

## Gender

- Modeled gender proportions using the same covariates and win–loss ratio exposure.
- Effects were modest and heterogeneous across schools; we did not observe a single dominant directional effect across the population.

Selected figures

- Men proportion vs win rate (SHAP):

- Women proportion vs win rate (SHAP):
  ![SHAP: UGDS_WOMEN vs win rate](/football-to-admissions/assets/img/Plots__UGDS_WOMEN_interaction.png)

## Higher-Caliber Proxies

- Proxies: ACT and SAT scores, retention, and completion rates.
- Models: XGBoost Regressors with SHAP to examine the marginal effect of win–loss ratio.

Summary of results

- Initial results were inconclusive overall.
- Effects varied by cost clusters; high-cost cluster shows little to no effect of win rate.

> Notes: Definitions of “high caliber” are fraught: test scores may reflect access to resources. Given heterogeneity and potential confounding, we avoid strong conclusions.

## Cost Clusters

- We clustered schools by overall cost (tuition + living expenses).
- School-type clustering did not materially change results; we emphasize cost-based clusters.

Key observations

- In high-cost institutions, win-rate effects on demographics are minimal.
- Effects are more pronounced in low- and mid-cost clusters.
